# CNN News Search Engine

This project is a search engine developed in Java using object-oriented programming principles. The search engine is designed to index and retrieve CNN news articles based on user queries, providing precise and relevant search results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilizes techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to clean and normalize text data.
- **Indexing:** Implements both forward and backward indexing mechanisms for efficient search operations.
- **Lexicon Management:** Builds lexicons to aid in filtering and indexing relevant words.
- **User Interface:** Provides a simple command-line interface for users to input queries and receive search results.
- **Error Handling:** Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience.
